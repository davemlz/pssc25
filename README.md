# Remote Sensing in Agriculture: Leveraging Cloud Technologies for Earth System Data Management

In an era where access to Earth system data—including climate data, Earth Observation data, and derived products—is expanding at an unprecedented rate, effectively managing this high-dimensional and voluminous influx poses significant challenges. The rise of cloud-based environments represents a revolutionary step forward in efficiently handling, analysing, and visualizing these complex datasets. The integration of novel cloud technologies and cloud-ready formats, such as Google Earth Engine (GEE), SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC), and Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COG), has greatly streamlined the use of Earth system data for diverse applications. This workshop is a comprehensive, interactive session designed to equip participants with the skills to query, retrieve, and manage Earth system data using open-source Python tools, with a focus on the terrestrial biosphere.

This repository contains the Hands-on session of the workshop.
